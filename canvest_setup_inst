1. ensure project directory has no spaces in it, canvest will not auto-add double quotes
    ex. use schoolWork not school work, canvest won't auto use "school work" and will only look for school
2. open project in vscode [administrator] so that powershell has admin permissions
3. open a powershell terminal
4. npm i @canvest/canvest-cli --save-dev
5. all tests should be in the canvest folder, following the name.canvest.js format
6. running npm test now should open a browser tab with the results of the test :)

for tests that need PIXI, make sure pixi is actually installed! npm install pixi.js
