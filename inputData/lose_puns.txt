You really folded under pressure!
That was a wash!
That was quite a tumble!
Wanna dry again?
You stink!
You are a detergent deterrent!
You need to iron out your skills!
Everything just unfolded!
What a mess!
Knocked your socks off!
Keep your shirt on!
You just got lint rolled!
You got starched!
That’s called the spin cycle!
Your colors are bleeding!
Start the cycle again!
That’s a stain on the record!
